# TODO

## Features

- Change to "global" bloom: https://learnopengl.com/Guest-Articles/2022/Phys.-Based-Bloom.

- Generalize tone mapping pass to dynamic range compression pass and include high-quality gamma correction.

- Experiment with new voxel data structure.

- Implement new multi-primitive render pipeline for voxels.

- Support voxel trees as rigid bodies.

- Implement collision detection and resolution.

## Performance

- Batch render pipelines that can be part of the same render pass.
