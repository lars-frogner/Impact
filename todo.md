# TODO

## Resources

- Add some form of dependency tracking for resource registries to automatically evict unused resources.

- Instead of loading resources directly from files, create a database for processed resources. Importing assets into the resource database is done offline. At runtime, the engine only loads from the resource database.

## Graphics

- Support clicking on rendered entities to display info based on their components.

- Look into clustered shading.

- Create general-purpose debug rendering API invokable from anywhere.

- Centralize assignment of binding locations?

## Physics

- Support disabling rigid bodies.

- Add more constraints.

- Implement Voronoi fracturing.

- Implement N-body gravity simulation using multipole expansion for the gravitational field of extended objects and a Barnes-Hut tree as acceleration structure.

## Math

- Replace `nalgebra` with custom library powered by `glam`.

## Performance

- Use single bind group for G-buffer attachments.

- Investigate ways to improve shadow map update performance (check out multiview render passes).

- Consider using `wgpu::TextureFormat::Rg11b10Float` for appropriate attachments.

- Handle rendering of single-chunk voxel objects separately in a more lightweight manner.

- Consider using Welzl's algorithm to compute better bounding spheres.

- Investigate where arena allocation could be beneficial.

- Add acceleration structure for broad phase collision detection.

## ECS

- Support querying only entities where certain components have changed.

- Consider reducing usage of `RwLock` in `impact_ecs`. Investigate scheduler as an alternative to locks.

## Roc

- Implement hot reloading of script.

- Support state/context in Roc script.

## Misc

- Fix black square flashes due to bloom filter propagating NaNs.

- Fix tiny gaps between chunk meshes due to numerical imprecision.

- Investigate flakyness of the `executing_tasks_works` test.
